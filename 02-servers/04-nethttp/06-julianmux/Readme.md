# Julian Schdmit's http Router 

This router is an alternate to the standard router and the main advantage of the router are: 
1. It is benchmarks that indicate it is much more performant to the standard library. 
2. We can capture parameters that are passed to the handler unlike the standard library that has an
   issue with path parameters. 

There are other routers that can be used like gorrila mux router which also has some good features
and it does not change the signautre of the handle func.
